)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred}{Data frame. Predicted probability of presence at occurrence and background locations}

\item{negrug}{Numeric. Model prediction of presence at background points.}

\item{posrug}{Numeric. Model prediction of presence at occurrence points.}

\item{ideal}{Function.}

\item{ylim}{Numeric. Two-element vector giving the x-axis for the plot; default is c(0, 1).}

\item{xlim}{Numeric. Two-element vector giving the y-axis for the plot; default is c(0, 1).}

\item{capuci}{Logical. Should the upper confidence limit of the smoothed probability of presence by clamped to 1?}

\item{xlabel}{Character. Label to be applied to the x-axis.}

\item{ylabel}{Character. Label to be applied to the y-axis.}

\item{filename}{Character. Full path to the file into which the graph will be plotted. Default of NULL plots to the standard graphics device.}

\item{title}{Character. Title for the plot. Default is a generic "Calibration plot".}

A ggplot2 object

\description{
Make a smoothed calibration plot for a presence-only model using the method by Phillips and Elith
}
\details{
{
This is an adaptation of code published by Phillips and Elith (2010. POC plots: calibrating species distribution models with presence-only data. Ecology 91:2476â€“2484).

Although it is possible to call this function with user-generated parameter values, it is ideally designed to be called by the function \link{POCplot}.

This implementation uses ggplot2 to render the plot.
