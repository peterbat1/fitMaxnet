#' Make buffer around occurrence points
#'
#' Produce an sf polygon object representing the boundary within which background points will be sampled for ENM fitting
#'
#' @param occ_pts An sf points object providing the X- and Y-coordinates of occurrence records
#' @param bufferDist_km Numeric. Size of buffer to be built around the occurrence points in kilometres. Default value of 200 km follows the advice of VanDerWal et al. (2009). See details below.
#' @param trace Logical. Should messages be emitted to assist progress tracking or debugging

#' \emph{bufferPoints()} implements the widely used simple circular buffering approach introduced to niche modelling by VanDerWal et al. 2009. 'Selecting pseudo-absence data for presence-only distribution modeling: How far should you stray from what you know?' \emph{Ecological Modelling} 220:589â€“594.
#' The default value of 200 km for the buffer distance is the value recommended by VanDerWal et al. (2009) for a range of taxa which they considered in their paper. Naturally, the value to be used is a matter for consideration by the user. If there is a clear indication from available information regarding a taxon's mode of dispersal, or there is guidance from population genetics data, then another value might be supplied for this parameter.
#' This implementation uses the spatial processing resources provided by the packages \emph{sp}, \emph{sf} and \emph{rgeos} to achieve good performance and accurate handling of spatial data.

#'@note {
#' Currently, this function can only process \bold{occurrence data from the Australian continent}. Providing global coverage is feasible and will be implemented shortly for the OzWeeds project.
#'
#' The function outputs a simple features ('sf') polygon object on the same projection which was inferred when \emph{occ_pts} was parsed. That is, either EPSG:4326 (WGS84) if 'longitude' and 'latitude' column names were found, or EPSG:3577 (Australian ALber's Equal Area) if 'X' and 'Y' column names were found. If you need to use the buffer polygon on other projections, please re-project the returned object using, say, \emph{st_transform()} from the package \emph{sf}.
